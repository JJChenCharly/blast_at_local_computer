# BLAST at local computer
Here we provide a tool **Blast_at_local_computer.ipynb** for the following works:
* download genome data from NCBI
* make a local custom genome database
* run BLAST search against local custom BLAST databases

This Jupyter notebook **Blast_at_local_computer.ipynb** should be run in a linux system, in which the following packages should be installed:
* `parallel`
* `rsync` 
* `ncbi-blast+`
